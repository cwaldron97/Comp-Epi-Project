# Comp-Epi-Project
## Project Goal
1. Make a contact network between people in Tokyo and NYC using check-in data 
2. Model disease movement and the impact of being a densely populated urban area
3. Find novel factors influencing disease spread


## Top Priorities
1. Picking what disease we want to study, and finding a way to model its infectivity and how it might propagate in an urban environment
2. Finding supplementary information to differentiate the cities, like transportation links (e.g. to adapt our distance function -- if someone can take a subway they're probably close to people on the other side of the city by that subway, spatially-temporally), access to health services, availability of public transportation, and differences in cultural practices (e.g. notions of personal space potentially impacting average distances people hold from one another)
